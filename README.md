Determine enthalpy change of single displacement reaction between zinc and copper sulphate 
Introduction: 
Zinc is placed at a higher position in the activity   series   compared to copper.   Hence zinc can displace copper from a solution of copper sulphate.   During this displacement reaction, heat evolved can be calculated in kJmol-1.   The amount of heat evolved can be used to determine the relative position of metals in the activity series.
Chemical: 
Apparatus: 


Styrofoam cup with lid 
Zinc powder (1.0 g)
